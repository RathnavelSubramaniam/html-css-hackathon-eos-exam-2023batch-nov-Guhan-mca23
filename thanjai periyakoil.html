				Between 1003 and 1010 AD, Raja Raja Chola I built the structure in the Dravidian architectural style. The Brihadeeswara Temple was built by Rajaraja Chola I and designed by Kunjara Mallan Raja Rama Perunthachan. The temple was dedicated to the goddess Brihadeeswara.</p>

			
			<h1>Brihadeeswara Temple history:</h1>
			<article>
				<h2>Tamil Nadu which is famed for Tamil architecture:</h2>
				<p>From the fifth through the ninth centuries, a spectrum of Hindu temple styles continued to emerge under the control of the Chalukyas, as indicated by the temples at Aihole, Badami, and Pattadakal, and later under the rule of the Pallavas, as evidenced by the temples at Mamallapuram and other sites. Between 850 and 1280 CE, the Cholas rose to prominence as the ruling dynasty. Cholas placed a higher priority on maintaining their geopolitical borders during the early Chola period while placing less emphasis on building. In the tenth century, architectural characteristics such as multifaceted columns with projecting square capitals began to be developed within the Chola empire. The beginning of the new Chola style, according to George Michell, was signified by this event. The term “note” refers to the first letter of the word “note.” When it comes to grandeur and intricacy, the Brihadeeswara temple, erected between 1003 and 1010 by Chola monarch Rajaraja I, is the best example of this South Indian architecture</p>
				<p>Brihadeeswara Temple (Peruvudaiyar Kovil) is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva that is located in Thanjavur, in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is the largest Hindu temple in the world. It is also referred to as Periya Kovil, RajaRajeswara Temple, and Rajarajeswaram, among other names. Located in the Chola region of India, it is one of the largest temples in the country and a fine example of Dravidian architecture from the time period. The temple, which was built by the ruler Raja Raja Chola I and finished in 1010 AD, celebrated its 1000th anniversary in 2010. The temple is one of three that make up the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the “Great Living Chola Temples,” the other two being the Brihadeeswara Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram, and Airavatesvara temple, all of which are located in the state of Tamil Nadu.</p>
