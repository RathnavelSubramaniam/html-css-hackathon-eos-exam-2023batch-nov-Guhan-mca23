				<h2>Tamil Nadu which is famed for Tamil architecture:</h2>
				<p>Meenakshi Amman Temple, also called Meenakshi Temple or Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, temple complex in Madurai, Tamil Nadu state, India, said to originally date as far back as the 4th century CE but in its present form built in the 16thâ€“17th centuries. According to Hindu legend, the god Shiva came to Madurai in the form of Sundareswarar to marry Meenakshi, the daughter of the Pandya ruler; Meenakshi was a manifestation of the goddess Parvati. The Meenakshi Amman Temple is dedicated to their union.</p>
				<p>The massive temple is enclosed by high walls entered through soaring gopuras, or gateway towers. Inside are colonnades, columned mandapas (halls, some of which were used for shops, storerooms, and stables), a sacred tank, lesser shrines, and, at the centre, the two main shrines to Sundareswarar and Meenakshi. The gopuras are some of the most elaborately decorated in India. Brightly painted, they are completely covered with figures of divinities, celestial beings, monster masks, guardians, and animal mounts. The tallest of the 14, the southern gopura, rises to more than 170 feet (52 m).</p>
